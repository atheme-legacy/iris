<h2>Can I make the widget autoconnect?</h2>

<p>No, if this was allowed then bad people could IFRAME lots and lots of copies, which would get you glined for having too many clones.<br/>However you can prefill the channel/nickname information (type /EMBED in the main window).</p>

<input type="submit" value="Close" class="close" />
